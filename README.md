# YouTube Subscribers & Visualization Hours Prediction

## Introduction

In this project, I will analyze the data from a YouTube channel focused on Chemistry classes for all levels. This YouTube channel has been actived since March 2021, publishing more than 120 videos until the current date. You can check the YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQTrA_c1BgRNLewVyt2UFw).

The data sources I will include in this project are the following ones:

* 

## Goals

The main question I want to answer with this project is determinating when the channel will be ready for monetization. In order to monetizate a channel on YouTube, you need two requirement:

* Gain 1000 subscribers 
* Get at least 4,000 organic visualization hours in one year



With this project, I want to achieve other secondary goals: 

* Performing an Exploratory Data Analysis to understand better the data and discover new trends that are difficult to see in the YouTube Analytics platform.
* Determinating if there is any relationship between the organic subscribers and the paid ones. This can be also applied to the visualization hours.
