# YouTube Subscribers & Visualization Hours Prediction

## Introduction

In this project, I will analyze the data from a YouTube channel focused on Chemistry classes for all levels. This YouTube channel has been actived since March 2021, publishing more than 120 videos until the current date. You can check the YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQTrA_c1BgRNLewVyt2UFw).

The data sources I will include in this project are the following ones:

* Video statistics with a daily granularity from YouTube: subscribers, views, likes/dislikes, comments, visualization hours...

* Other interesting metrics based on the country, for example.

* Google Ads data, available only for the videos that were part of the paid campaigns. This data will be displayed per day and per video. Some of the metrics will be: impressions, clicks, CTR, CPV...

## Goals

The main question I want to answer with this project is determinating when the channel will be ready for monetization. In order to monetizate a channel on YouTube, you need two requirement:

* Gain 1000 subscribers 
* Get at least 4,000 organic visualization hours in one year

I will answer to this question creating a time series prediction based on statistics methodologies.

With this project, I want to achieve other secondary goals: 

* Performing an Exploratory Data Analysis to understand better the data and discover new trends that are difficult to see in the YouTube Analytics platform.
* Determinating if stopping the campaigns in Google Ads affects in any negative or positive way to the organic growth of the channel.
